class FADiff:

    This is the main API class of the package. It acts as an object factory
    from which a user can create objects that are used in automatic
    differentiation (AD) calculations. Each object has @property decorator
    methods called val and der which the user can call using the object in order
    to get the value and derivative/jacobian associated with it.

    Attributes:
